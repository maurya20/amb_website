      <p><b> Training content of CASPOC Software</b><br><br>
        The broad objectives shall be as given below for the CASPOC Software
        Modeling and simulation is a valuable tool in the area of education and training. Especially in the field of
        power
        electronics and drives. Animation gives valuable information about the simulation of Power Electronics and
        Electrical Drives. Displaying current-paths gives insight in the behavior of the circuit and can reveal failure
        modes. It reveals more insight in the circuit operation then only displaying simulation results in graphs.
        In this instructor-led, live training, participants will learn how to use the Caspoc software to create Power
        Electronics circuits and build applications and projects. CASPOC is used in the design and simulation of complex
        power and control devices and systems such as: Rectifiers, DC Converters, AC Converters Resonant Converters,
        Power Engineering, Induction Machines, Vector Controls, Mechanics, Active Filters, Harmonics, DC Machines,
        Stepper Motors and more, used in such industries as: Aerospace, Automotive, Utility, Industrial, Transportation,
        Commercial Electronics and many more... The course starts by examining a set of existing schematics, then
        drawing
        out an original circuit in Caspoc. The training steps through various process steps involved in designing and
        discuss
        and explore each step-in detail with live examples and hands-on-practical sessions.Certificate after completion.
        The main objective of PLC & Scada is to make the aspiring engineers acquainted with the conceptual as well as
        practical knowledge of the Industrial Automation & latest technologies being used to achieve industrial
        automation.
        The idea of organizing this workshop is to inculcate the basic fundamentals of automation in the students and
        provide them with a platform to work on, In the Near Future.</p>
